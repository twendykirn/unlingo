## Overview

Releases in Unlingo are snapshots of your translations that are published and made available for production use. They represent stable, tested versions of your content that applications can reliably consume through the API.

Think of releases as Git tags - they create a reference to a specific version of your translations, that you can change on the fly without changing application code.

## Creating Releases

Create a release and assign an existing versions:

1. Navigate to your project's **Releases** tab
2. Click **Create Release**
3. Select the **namespace**
4. Select the **version** from namespace
5. Repeat steps 3-4 if you have multiple namespaces
6. Enter **release name** (e.g., `1.2.0`)
7. Add **release description** (optional)
8. Click **Create Release**

### Release Numbering

Releases support various numbering schemes:

**Semantic Versioning (Recommended):**

```
1.0.0     # Initial release
1.0.1     # Patch release
1.1.0     # Minor release
2.0.0     # Major release
```

**Date-based Versioning:**

```
2024.01.15    # Release date
2024-Q1       # Quarterly release
2024-W03      # Weekly release
```

**Named Releases:**

```
winter-2024       # Seasonal release
mobile-launch     # Feature release
hotfix-jan        # Emergency release
```

## Release Management

### Editing Releases

You can modify certain aspects of published releases:

1. **Description**: Update description (it won't affect any usage)
2. **Namespaces and Versions**: You can modify selected namespaces and versions

### Deleting Releases

To delete a release:

1. Go to the **Releases** tab
2. Find the release to delete
3. Click the **â‹®** menu
4. Select **Delete Release**
5. Confirm the deletion

<Danger>
    Deleting a release immediately breaks any applications using that release number in their API calls. Ensure no
    active integrations depend on the release before deletion.
</Danger>

## API Integration

### Fetching Release Content

Applications consume releases through the API:

```javascript
// Fetch specific release
const translations = await fetch('/v1/translations', {
    params: {
        namespace: 'common',
        release: '1.2.0', // Release name
        lang: 'en',
    },
});
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Release Usage

Track how releases are being used:

- **API calls per release**: Which releases are active
- **Language distribution**: Most requested languages
- **Namespace popularity**: Most accessed namespaces

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title='Missing translations in release'>
        - **Problem**:
          - Release missing some expected translations.
        - **Solutions**:
          - Verify release name in API call
          - Verify source version had complete translations
          - Check if languages were properly included
          - Ensure version wasn't modified during release creation
          - Set updated version
