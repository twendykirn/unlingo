## What are Namespaces?

**Namespaces** are logical containers within a project that group related translations together. They help organize your translation keys by feature, component, or any other logical division that makes sense for your application.

Think of namespaces as folders in a file system - they provide structure and help prevent naming conflicts while making translations easier to manage.

## Why Use Namespaces?

## Namespace Structure

A typical application might use this namespace structure:

```
Project: E-commerce Website
├── common/          # Shared UI elements
│   ├── buttons
│   ├── navigation
│   └── forms
├── product-catalog/ # Product listing and details
│   ├── filters
│   ├── search
│   └── product-card
├── checkout/        # Purchase flow
│   ├── cart
│   ├── payment
│   └── confirmation
└── user-account/    # User profile and settings
    ├── profile
    ├── orders
    └── preferences
```

## Creating Namespaces

### Via Dashboard

<Steps>
    <Step title='Navigate to Project'>Go to your project dashboard and select the project you want to work with</Step>
    <Step title='Go to Namespaces Tab'>Click on the "Namespaces" tab in your project navigation</Step>
    <Step title='Create New Namespace'>Click "Create Namespace" and fill in the details.</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>By default new namespaces are created with `main` version.</Info>

## Namespace Branches

Each namespace has **production** and **development** branches by default. These branches allow you to work on translations independently:

- **Production branch**: Contains stable, production-ready translations
- **Development branch**: Used for testing and developing new translations before they go live

### Branch Merging

You can merge branches into each other to synchronize translations. When merging branches:

<Warning>
Branch merging is a **full merge** operation that:
- **Removes languages** that don't exist in the source branch
- **Creates new languages** if the target branch doesn't have them
- **Fully updates content** in matching languages

This is a destructive operation that completely synchronizes the target branch with the source branch.
</Warning>

<Steps>
    <Step title='Select Source Branch'>Choose the branch you want to merge from</Step>
    <Step title='Select Target Branch'>Choose the branch you want to merge into</Step>
    <Step title='Review Changes'>Understand that the target will be fully synchronized with the source</Step>
    <Step title='Confirm Merge'>Execute the merge operation</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Keep Namespaces Focused

<Warning>
    Avoid creating overly broad namespaces that contain unrelated translations. This makes maintenance difficult and
    reduces the benefits of organization.
</Warning>

#### Good: Focused Namespaces

```
auth/              # Only authentication-related
product-search/    # Only search functionality
user-preferences/  # Only user settings
```

#### Avoid: Overly Broad Namespaces

```
misc/              # Too vague
frontend/          # Too broad
translations/      # Doesn't provide organization
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title='Namespace not found error'>
        **Verify that:** - The namespace name is spelled correctly - The namespace exists in your project - Your API key
        has access to the namespace - The namespace is included in the current release
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
