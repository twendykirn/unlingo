## What are Projects?

A **Project** in Unlingo represents a single application or product that requires internationalization. Projects serve as the top-level container for organizing all translation-related resources including namespaces, versions, releases, and API keys.

/>

## Project Structure

Each project contains:

- **Namespaces**: Logical groupings of related translations
- **Releases**: Versioned collections of translations ready for deployment
- **API Keys**: Authentication credentials scoped to the project
- **Settings**: Configuration options and team permissions

## Creating Projects

### Via Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Dashboard">
    Sign in to your Unlingo account and go to the main dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create Project">
    Click the "Create Project" button on your dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill Project Details">
    Enter the required information:
    - **Name**: A descriptive name for your project
    - **Description**: Brief description of the application
    - **Default Language**: The primary language for your application
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Settings">
    Set up initial project settings:
    - **Team Access**: Invite team members
    - **Permissions**: Set role-based access controls
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Via API

You can also create projects programmatically:

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.unlingo.com/v1/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Web Application",
    "description": "E-commerce website with multi-language support",
    "defaultLanguage": "en"
  }'
```

## Project Settings

### Basic Information

- **Project Name**: Display name for your project
- **Description**: Detailed description of the project's purpose
- **Default Language**: The fallback language for missing translations
- **Project ID**: Unique identifier used in API requests

### Team Management

  <Card
    title="Team Members"
    icon="users"
  >
    Invite developers, translators, and project managers to collaborate
  </Card>
  <Card

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### API Configuration

- **Rate Limits**: Configure request limits per API key
- **CORS Settings**: Manage cross-origin request permissions
- **Webhook URLs**: Set up notifications for project events

## Project Roles

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Admin">
    - Can manage namespaces, versions, and releases
    - Can invite team members (except other admins)
    - Can create API keys with limited scope
    - Cannot delete the project
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Developer">
    - Can create and edit translations

    - Cannot manage team members
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Translator">

    - Cannot create or delete translation keys
    - Cannot create versions or releases
    - Read-only access to project structure
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Viewer">

    - Cannot make any changes
    - Useful for stakeholders and reviewers
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### Project Organization

<Tip>
  **One Project per Application**: Create separate projects for different applications, even if they share some translations. This provides better isolation and access control.
</Tip>

#### Good Project Structure
```
- My E-commerce Website (Project)
  ├── common (Namespace)
  ├── product-catalog (Namespace)
  ├── checkout (Namespace)
  └── user-account (Namespace)

- My Mobile App (Project)
  ├── onboarding (Namespace)
  ├── main-navigation (Namespace)
  └── settings (Namespace)
```

#### Avoid This Structure
```
- All Company Products (Project)
  ├── website-common (Namespace)
  ├── website-product-catalog (Namespace)
  ├── mobile-onboarding (Namespace)
  └── mobile-navigation (Namespace)
```

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive names for your projects:

- ✅ **Good**: "E-commerce Website", "Customer Mobile App", "Admin Dashboard"
- ❌ **Avoid**: "Project 1", "Test", "My App"

### Environment Separation

Consider creating separate projects for different environments:

- **Production Project**: `myapp-production`
- **Staging Project**: `myapp-staging`
- **Development Project**: `myapp-development`

This approach provides:
- Complete isolation between environments
- Different team access levels
- Separate API keys and rate limits
- Independent release cycles

## Common Patterns

### Multi-Brand Applications

For applications serving multiple brands or white-label solutions:

```
- Brand A Website (Project)
- Brand B Website (Project)  
- Shared Components (Project)
```

Use the Shared Components project for common translations, then import them into brand-specific projects.

### Microservices Architecture

For microservices, you can choose between:

#### Single Project Approach
```
- Company Platform (Project)
  ├── user-service (Namespace)
  ├── payment-service (Namespace)
  ├── notification-service (Namespace)
  └── common-ui (Namespace)
```

#### Multiple Projects Approach
```
- User Service (Project)
- Payment Service (Project)
- Notification Service (Project)
- Common UI Library (Project)
```

<Note>
  The single project approach is often easier to manage, while multiple projects provide better service isolation. Choose based on your team structure and deployment requirements.
</Note>

## Project Analytics

Track your project's usage and performance:

### Translation Coverage
- **Language Completion**: Percentage of keys translated per language
- **Missing Translations**: Keys that need translation
- **Review Status**: Translation keys pending review

### API Usage
- **Request Volume**: API calls over time
- **Error Rates**: Failed requests and common errors
- **Geographic Distribution**: Where your translations are being fetched

### Team Activity
- **Recent Changes**: Timeline of translation updates
- **Contributor Activity**: Who's working on what
- **Release History**: Version deployment timeline

## Project Migration

### Importing Existing Translations

If you're migrating from another translation service:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export Current Translations">
    Export your translations in JSON, CSV, or other supported formats
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Project Structure">
    Set up your project with appropriate namespaces
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import Translations">
    Use our bulk import API or dashboard upload feature
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate Imports">
    Review imported translations for accuracy and completeness
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Bulk Import Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.unlingo.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/import \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "namespace": "common",
    "format": "json",
    "translations": {
      "en": {
        "welcome": "Welcome",
        "login": "Sign In"
      },
      "es": {
        "welcome": "Bienvenido",
        "login": "Iniciar Sesión"
      }
    }
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cannot create project">
    Check that you haven't reached your plan's project limit. Free accounts are limited to 1 project, while paid plans allow unlimited projects.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Team member cannot access project">
    Verify that:
    - The user has been properly invited to the project
    - They have the correct role assigned
    - They have accepted the invitation
    - Their account email matches the invitation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API calls failing with project errors">
    Ensure that:
    - Your API key is associated with the correct project
    - The project ID in your requests is accurate
    - Your API key has the necessary permissions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
