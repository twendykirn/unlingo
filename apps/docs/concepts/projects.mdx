## What are Projects?

A **Project** in Unlingo represents a single application or product that requires internationalization. Projects serve as the top-level container for organizing all translation-related resources including namespaces, versions, releases, and API keys.

## Project Structure

Each project contains:

- **Namespaces**: Logical groupings of related translations
- **Releases**: Versioned collections of translations ready for deployment
- **Screenshots**: Visual translation mapping for UI elements
- **API Keys**: Authentication credentials scoped to the project
- **Settings**: Configuration options

## Creating Projects

### Via Dashboard

<Steps>
    <Step title='Navigate to Dashboard'>Sign in to your Unlingo account and go to the main dashboard</Step>
    <Step title='Click Create Project'>Click the "Create Project" button on your dashboard</Step>
    <Step title='Fill Project Details'>Enter the required information</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Project Organization

<Tip>
    **One Project per Application**: Create separate projects for different applications, even if they share some
    translations. This provides better isolation and access control.
</Tip>

#### Good Project Structure

```
- My E-commerce Website (Project)
  ├── common (Namespace)
  ├── product-catalog (Namespace)
  ├── checkout (Namespace)
  └── user-account (Namespace)

- My Mobile App (Project)
  ├── onboarding (Namespace)
  ├── main-navigation (Namespace)
  └── settings (Namespace)
```

#### Avoid This Structure

```
- All Company Products (Project)
  ├── website-common (Namespace)
  ├── website-product-catalog (Namespace)
  ├── mobile-onboarding (Namespace)
  └── mobile-navigation (Namespace)
```
