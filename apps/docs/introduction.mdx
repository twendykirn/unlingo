## How It Works

Unlingo follows a simple, intuitive workflow:

1. **Create Projects & Namespaces**: Organize your translations into logical groups
2. **Upload Translations**: Add your translation keys and values through our dashboard or API
3. **Create Releases**: Package your translations into versioned releases
4. **Integrate**: Use our SDKs or REST API to fetch translations in your application
5. **Deploy**: Your translations are automatically distributed globally via our CDN

<Note>
  Unlingo is designed to work with your existing translation workflow. You can import existing translations and start using the platform immediately.
