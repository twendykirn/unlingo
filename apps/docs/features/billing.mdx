</CardGroup>

## Usage Limits

### API Requests

API requests are counted each time your application fetches translations through the API:

```
GET /v1/translations?release=main&namespace=common&lang=en
```

Each request counts against your monthly limit regardless of response size.

### Translation Keys

Translation keys are counted across all projects in your workspace:

- Each unique translation key counts once
- Keys across multiple namespaces are counted separately
- Deleted keys free up capacity immediately

<Tip>
    Monitor your usage regularly through the dashboard to avoid hitting limits during peak times.
</Tip>

## Usage Alerts

Unlingo sends email notifications at key usage thresholds:

### Downgrading Your Plan

- Downgrades take effect at the next billing cycle
- Ensure your usage fits within the new limits

## Billing Cycle

- Usage resets at the start of each billing month

- Month 2: February 15 - March 14
- And so on...

- Monitor usage trends

### Planning Ahead

- Review usage patterns monthly
- Plan upgrades before hitting limits
- Set up alerts for usage spikes
- Consider annual plans for savings
