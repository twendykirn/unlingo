## What are Languages?

**Languages** in Unlingo define the target locales for your translation project. Each project has a primary language (typically your source language) and can have multiple target languages for translation.

## Language Structure

Each language in a project includes:

- **Language Code**: Standard locale code (e.g., `en-US`, `fr-FR`, `ja`)
- **Primary Flag**: Whether this is the source language
- **Translation Rules**: Custom rules applied during translation
- **Status**: Active or processing state

## Adding Languages

### Via Dashboard

<Steps>
    <Step title='Open Project Settings'>
        Navigate to your project and open the Languages section
    </Step>
    <Step title='Add Language'>
        Click "Add Language" and select from available locales
    </Step>
    <Step title='Configure Options'>
        Choose whether to enable automatic backfill translation
    </Step>
    <Step title='Save'>
        The language is added and translations begin if backfill is enabled
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Automatic Backfill

When adding a new language with backfill enabled, Unlingo automatically:

1. Identifies all existing translation keys
2. Uses AI (Google Gemini) to translate from the primary language
3. Creates translation values for the new language
4. Applies any language-specific rules during translation

<Tip>
    Enable backfill for instant translations when adding new languages to established projects.
</Tip>

## Translation Rules

Translation rules help maintain consistency across your translations:

```json
{
  "preserveCase": true,
  "formalTone": true,
  "customTerms": {
    "Dashboard": "Tableau de bord",
    "Settings": "Paramètres"
  }
}
```

### Rule Types

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `preserveCase` | Maintain original casing in translations |
| `formalTone` | Use formal language (vous vs tu in French) |
| `customTerms` | Specific term translations that override AI |

## Primary Language

The primary language serves as the source for all translations:

- All translation keys must have values in the primary language
- Auto-translation uses primary language values as source
- Changing the primary language doesn't automatically re-translate

<Warning>
    Choose your primary language carefully. Changing it later requires manual re-translation of existing content.
</Warning>

## Language Deletion

When deleting a language:

1. All translation values for that language are removed
2. Build files containing the language are updated
3. The operation cannot be undone

<Danger>
    Deleting a language permanently removes all translations for that language. Export your translations first if you need a backup.
</Danger>

## Best Practices

### Language Selection

<Tip>
    **Start with Core Languages**: Begin with your most important markets, then expand. It's easier to manage 3-5 languages well than 20 poorly.
</Tip>

- Use standard locale codes (e.g., `en-US` not `english`)
- Consider regional variants when necessary (`es-ES` vs `es-MX`)
- Group similar languages for easier rule management

### Translation Quality

- Review auto-translated content before publishing
- Use glossary terms for consistent brand language
- Set up translation rules for formal/informal tone

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title='Auto-translation not working'>
        Ensure your project has a primary language set and that the primary language has values for all translation keys.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Wrong translations appearing'>
        Check your translation rules and glossary terms. Custom terms override AI translations.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Cannot delete language'>
        A language currently being processed cannot be deleted. Wait for all operations to complete.
