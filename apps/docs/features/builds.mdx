## What are Builds?

A **Build** in Unlingo is a generated snapshot of your translations at a specific point in time. Builds create JSON files for each language that can be served to your application through releases.

## Key Features

## Build Structure

Each build includes:

- **Build Tag**: A unique identifier/name for the build
- **Namespace**: The namespace being built
- **Language Files**: JSON files for each language
- **Status**: Processing, completed, or failed
- **Created At**: Timestamp of build creation

## Build Generation Process

<Steps>
    <Step title='Initiate Build'>
        Create a build from the dashboard or API
    </Step>
    <Step title='Collect Translations'>
        System gathers all translation keys and values for the namespace
    </Step>
    <Step title='Generate JSON'>
        Creates JSON files for each language in the namespace
    </Step>
    <Step title='Upload to Storage'>
        Files are securely uploaded to S3
    </Step>
    <Step title='Build Complete'>
        Build is marked complete and ready for release
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating Builds

### Via Dashboard

<Steps>
    <Step title='Navigate to Namespace'>
        Open your project and select the namespace you want to build
    </Step>
    <Step title='Click Create Build'>
        Click the "Create Build" button in the builds section
    </Step>
    <Step title='Enter Build Tag'>
        Provide a meaningful tag (e.g., "v1.2.0", "release-2024-01")
    </Step>
    <Step title='Confirm'>
        Build generation begins automatically
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Build Output Format

Builds generate JSON files in a flat key-value format:

```json
{
  "welcome.title": "Welcome to our app",
  "welcome.subtitle": "Get started today",
  "navigation.home": "Home",
  "navigation.settings": "Settings",
  "errors.notFound": "Page not found"
}
```

<Tip>
    The JSON format is compatible with most i18n libraries including i18next, next-intl, react-intl, and vue-i18n.
</Tip>

## Build Tags

Tags help identify and organize builds:

### Naming Conventions

| Pattern | Example | Use Case |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Semantic Version | `v1.2.0` | Production releases |
| Date-based | `2024-01-15` | Daily builds |
| Feature-based | `feature-dark-mode` | Feature testing |
| Environment | `staging-build` | Environment-specific |

<Warning>
    Build tags must be unique within a namespace. Attempting to create a build with an existing tag will fail.
</Warning>

## Build Status

Builds go through several states:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Processing | Build generation in progress |
| Completed | All language files generated successfully |
| Failed | Error during generation |

### Handling Failed Builds

If a build fails:

1. Check that all translations have values in the primary language
2. Verify namespace contains translation keys
3. Review any error messages in the build details
4. Delete the failed build and retry

## Managing Builds

### Viewing Build Details

Access build details to see:

- Generation timestamp
- Number of language files
- File sizes
- Direct download links (signed URLs)

### Deleting Builds

When deleting a build:

- All S3 files are removed
- Release connections are automatically updated
- The operation cannot be undone

<Danger>
    Before deleting a build, ensure it's not actively used by any release. Releases will automatically rebalance if their builds are deleted.
</Danger>

## Best Practices

### Build Strategy

<Tip>
    **Build Often, Release Selectively**: Create builds frequently during development, but only create releases for production-ready content.
</Tip>

- Create builds after significant translation updates
- Use meaningful tags for easy identification
- Keep recent builds for rollback capability

### Performance

- Build namespaces individually for faster generation
- Avoid building during peak usage times
- Monitor build completion before creating releases

### Cleanup

- Regularly delete old, unused builds
- Archive important builds before deletion
- Maintain at least 2-3 builds for rollback

## Build Files and Storage

Build files are stored securely in AWS S3:

- Files are private by default
- Access through signed URLs (time-limited)
- Automatic cleanup when builds are deleted

### File Naming

```
{namespace}/{build_id}/{language}.json
```

Example:
```
common/build_abc123/en.json
common/build_abc123/fr.json
common/build_abc123/de.json
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title='Build stuck in processing'>
        Large namespaces with many keys may take longer. Wait a few minutes. If it persists, delete and retry.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Build completed but no files'>
        Ensure the namespace has translation keys with values. Empty namespaces produce empty builds.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Cannot delete build'>
        A build actively being processed cannot be deleted. Wait for completion or failure first.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Missing language in build'>
        Check that the language exists in your project and has translations for the namespace being built.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
