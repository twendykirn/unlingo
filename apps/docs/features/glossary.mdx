## What is the Glossary?

The **Glossary** in Unlingo is a project-wide dictionary of terms that controls how specific words and phrases are translated. It ensures consistent terminology across all languages and helps maintain brand voice.

## Glossary Term Structure

Each glossary term includes:

- **Term**: The word or phrase to match
- **Description**: Context for translators
- **Translations**: Language-specific translations
- **Non-translatable**: Whether to keep the original term
- **Forbidden**: Whether to warn when term is used
- **Case Sensitive**: Whether matching is case-sensitive

    </Step>
    <Step title='Set Options'>
        Configure non-translatable, forbidden, and case sensitivity flags
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Term Types

### Standard Terms

Standard terms define how specific words should be translated:

```json
{
  "term": "Dashboard",
  "description": "The main user interface",
  "translations": {
    "fr": "Tableau de bord",
    "de": "Übersicht",
    "es": "Panel de control"
  }
}
```

### Non-translatable Terms

Mark brand names, product names, or technical terms that should remain unchanged:

```json
{
  "term": "Unlingo",
  "nonTranslatable": true,
  "description": "Our product name - never translate"
}
```

<Tip>
    Use non-translatable terms for brand names, product features, and technical terminology that should remain consistent globally.
</Tip>

### Forbidden Terms

Flag outdated or inappropriate terminology:

```json
{
  "term": "deprecated-feature",
  "forbidden": true,
  "description": "This feature has been removed - do not reference"
}
```

<Warning>
    Forbidden terms generate warnings during translation but don't block the process.
</Warning>

## Case Sensitivity

Control how terms are matched:

| Setting | Example | Matches |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Case Sensitive | "API" | "API" only |
| Case Insensitive | "api" | "api", "API", "Api" |

## Best Practices

### Building Your Glossary

<Tip>
    **Start with Brand Terms**: Begin by adding all brand names, product names, and key feature terminology to ensure consistency from day one.
</Tip>

1. **Brand Terms**: Company name, product names, feature names
2. **Technical Terms**: Industry-specific terminology
3. **UI Elements**: Button labels, menu items, section headers
4. **Tone Words**: Terms that define your brand voice

### Glossary Organization

- Add descriptions for context
- Group related terms logically
- Review and update regularly
- Remove outdated terms

### Translation Quality

- Verify translations with native speakers
- Consider regional variations
- Test in context

## Glossary in AI Translation

The glossary is automatically applied during:

- Automatic translation of new keys
- Language backfill operations
- Batch translation actions

AI translations will:
1. Check for glossary matches
2. Apply defined translations
3. Keep non-translatable terms
4. Flag forbidden terms

## Example Glossary

```json
[
  {
    "term": "Unlingo",
    "nonTranslatable": true,
    "description": "Product name"
  },
  {
    "term": "Dashboard",
    "translations": {
      "fr": "Tableau de bord",
      "de": "Übersicht",
      "es": "Panel"
    }
  },
  {
    "term": "Settings",
    "translations": {
      "fr": "Paramètres",
      "de": "Einstellungen",
      "es": "Configuración"
    }
  },
  {
    "term": "old-branding",
    "forbidden": true,
    "description": "Deprecated - use new brand name"
  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

    <Accordion title='Glossary terms not being applied'>
        Check that case sensitivity settings match your content. Also verify the term exists in your glossary.

    <Accordion title='AI ignoring glossary translations'>
        Ensure translations are defined for the target language in the glossary term.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Too many matches'>
        Use case sensitivity for terms that shouldn't match common words.
