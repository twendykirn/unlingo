## When AI Translation is Used

AI translation triggers automatically in these scenarios:

### New Translation Keys

When you create a new translation key:

1. You provide the value in the primary language
2. AI translates to all other project languages
3. Translations are created automatically

### Language Backfill

When you add a new language to a project:

1. System identifies existing translation keys
2. AI translates all keys from primary language
3. New language is populated with translations

### Manual Translation Request

You can trigger AI translation manually:

1. Select keys needing translation
2. Click "Translate" or "Auto-translate"
3. AI generates translations for missing languages

## Translation Quality

### Glossary Integration

AI translation automatically applies your glossary:

```json
// Glossary Term
{
  "term": "Dashboard",
  "translations": {
    "fr": "Tableau de bord"
  }
}

// AI Output
"Dashboard" → "Tableau de bord" (uses glossary)
"Settings" → "Paramètres" (AI translated)
```

### Non-translatable Terms

Terms marked as non-translatable are preserved:

```json
// Glossary
{
  "term": "Unlingo",
  "nonTranslatable": true
}

// Input: "Welcome to Unlingo"
// Output: "Bienvenue sur Unlingo"  // Brand name preserved
```

### Context Consideration

AI considers surrounding content for better translations:

- Key names provide context
- Related keys inform tone
- Project-wide patterns are learned

<Tip>
    Use descriptive key names like `checkout.payment.submit` instead of `btn1` for better AI context.
</Tip>

## Batch Translation

For large-scale translation needs:

### How It Works

<Steps>
    <Step title='Select Keys'>
        Choose keys that need translation
    </Step>
    <Step title='Choose Languages'>
        Select target languages
    </Step>
    <Step title='Start Batch'>
        Initiate batch translation process
    </Step>
    <Step title='Progress Tracking'>
        Monitor translation progress
    </Step>
    <Step title='Review'>
        Review and adjust translations
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Performance

| Keys | Approximate Time |
|------|-----------------|
| 10 | Few seconds |
| 100 | ~30 seconds |
| 1,000 | ~5 minutes |

<Warning>
    Large batch operations may take several minutes. The process runs in the background.
</Warning>

## Translation Rules

Configure language-specific translation rules:

### Formal vs Informal

```json
{
  "language": "de",
  "rules": {
    "formalTone": true  // Uses "Sie" instead of "du"
  }
}
```

### Regional Variants

Different rules for regional language variants:

- `es-ES` - Spanish (Spain)
- `es-MX` - Spanish (Mexico)

## Best Practices

### Improving AI Quality

    <Card title='Build Glossary' icon='book'>
        Add key terms for consistent translations
    </Card>
    <Card title='Clear Source Text' icon='text'>
        Write clear, unambiguous source content
    </Card>
    <Card title='Review Output' icon='eye'>
        Always review AI translations before publishing
    </Card>
    <Card title='Provide Context' icon='info'>
        Use descriptive key names and descriptions
    </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Source Text Guidelines

**Good source text:**
```json
{
  "checkout.submit": "Complete your purchase"
}
```

**Avoid:**
```json
{
  "btn1": "Click here"  // No context
}
```

### Review Process

1. AI generates initial translations
2. Review translations for accuracy
3. Check brand-specific terminology
4. Verify cultural appropriateness
5. Test in context

## Limitations

### What AI Handles Well

- General UI text
- Common phrases
- Structured content
- Technical documentation

### What Needs Human Review

- Marketing copy and slogans
- Legal or medical content
- Culturally sensitive material
- Creative writing
- Humor and idioms

<Warning>
    AI translation is a starting point. Critical content should always be reviewed by native speakers.
</Warning>

## Cost Considerations

AI translation usage is included in your plan:

- Translation requests don't count against API limits
- Batch translations are processed efficiently
- No additional charges for AI features

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title='Translation not matching glossary'>
        Verify the glossary term exists and has a translation for the target language.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Poor quality translations'>
        - Check source text clarity
        - Add context through key names
        - Build out your glossary
        - Consider translation rules
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Translation taking too long'>
        Large batches may take several minutes. Check progress in the dashboard.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Some keys not translated'>
        Ensure the primary language has values for all keys. AI cannot translate empty source text.
