## What are Workspaces?

A **Workspace** in Unlingo represents an organization-level container that manages team access, billing, usage tracking, and resource limits. Workspaces are automatically created when you sign up and are linked to your Clerk organization.

## Usage Monitoring

Unlingo tracks your usage and sends notifications at key thresholds:

<Steps>
    <Step title='80% Warning'>
        You receive an email notification when approaching your limit
    </Step>
    <Step title='100% Limit Reached'>
        Notification that you've reached your plan limit
    </Step>
    <Step title='130% Hard Limit'>
        API requests are blocked until the next billing cycle or upgrade
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Your Workspace

### Viewing Usage

Navigate to your workspace settings to view:

- Current month's API request count
- Total translation keys across all projects
- Days until usage reset
- Subscription status and limits

### Updating Contact Email

Your workspace contact email receives important notifications including:

- Usage alerts and warnings
- Billing notifications
- Security alerts

<Warning>
    The contact email must be unique across all Unlingo workspaces.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Resource Management

<Tip>
    **Monitor Usage Regularly**: Check your usage dashboard weekly to avoid hitting limits unexpectedly.
</Tip>

- Archive unused projects to free up translation key limits
- Clean up old namespaces that are no longer in use
- Consider upgrading before hitting 80% usage

### Team Organization

- Use meaningful project names that reflect their purpose
- Assign clear ownership of projects within your team
- Regularly review team member access

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title='API requests are being blocked'>
        You may have exceeded 130% of your plan's request limit. Check your usage in the dashboard and consider upgrading your plan or waiting for the monthly reset.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Cannot create new translation keys'>
        Your workspace has reached its translation key limit. Delete unused keys or upgrade your subscription tier.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='Usage not resetting'>
        Usage resets at the start of each billing month based on your subscription date, not the calendar month.
    </Accordion>
